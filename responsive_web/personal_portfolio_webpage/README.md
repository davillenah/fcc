# Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage

**Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: [Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG).

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

**User Story #1**: My portfolio should have a _welcome section_ with an `id="welcome-section"`.

**User Story #2**: The `#welcome-section` should have an _h1 element_ that contains text.

**User Story #3**: My portfolio should have a _projects section_ with an `id="projects"`.

**User Story #4**: The _projects section_ should contain at least one element with a `class="project-tile"` to hold a project.

**User Story #5**: The _projects section_ should contain at least one link to a project.

**User Story #6**: My portfolio should have a _navbar_ with an `id="navbar"`.

**User Story #7**: The _navbar_ should contain at least one link that I can click on to navigate to different sections of the page.

**User Story #8**: My portfolio should have a _link_ with an `id="profile-link"`, which opens my _GitHub or FCC profile_ in a new tab.

**User Story #9**: My portfolio should have at least _one media query_.

**User Story #10**: The _height_ of the _welcome section_ should be equal to the _height_ of the viewport.

**User Story #11**: The _navbar_ should always be at the _top of the viewport_.

You can build your project by forking this CodePen pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: [Test](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js)

Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.
